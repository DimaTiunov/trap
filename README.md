Buggregator Trap, the streamlined Command Line Interface (CLI) version of Buggregator, marks a new era in debugging PHP applications. Boasting an array of powerful debugging "traps", including:

- Symfony var-dumper,
- Monolog,
- Sentry,
- SMTP,
- HTTP dumps,
- and Ray

This lightweight tool facilitates and streamlines the process of debugging for developers, regardless of their environment.

It enables you to easily install a client in your PHP application using a Composer package and run a local server specifically designed for debugging. This isn't just a debugging tool, it's a supercharged version of the `symfony/var-dumper` server, designed to offer more versatility and in-depth insights into your code.

Now you can effortlessly visualize and analyze console information about various elements of your codebase.

Here's a sneak peek into the console output you can expect with traps:

Debug with Buggregator to fix problems faster

* Use in WordPress or any PHP project
* See models, mails, queries, â€¦ in Laravel
* Debug locally or via SSH
* Works with Javascript, Node.js and Ruby
* Measure performance & set breakpoints

Download: https://github.com/buggregator/app
```

In addition to the local debugging features, Buggregator Trap provides an innovative functionality as a proxy client. It can transmit data to a remote Buggregator server, thereby facilitating a centralized debugging process for your team or organization.


## Installation

To install Buggregator Trap in your PHP application, add the package as a dependency to your project using Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev buggregator/trap:*
```

## Usage

After successfully installing Buggregator Trap, you can initiate the debugging process by using the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/trap
```

This command will activate the Trap server, setting it up to listen for all TCP requests. Upon receiving these requests, the server will search for a corresponding listener that can process the incoming data and display a dump accordingly.

Then just call the `trap()` function in your code:

```php
trap(); // dump current stack trace
trap($var); // dump variable
trap($var, foo: $far, bar: $bar); // dump variables sequence
```

The `trap()` function configures `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` and `$_SERVER['REMOTE_PORT']` automatically, if they are not set. Also, it can dump google/protobuf messages.

### Default port

By default, the Trap server operates on port `9912`. However, if you wish to utilize a different port, you can easily make this adjustment using the `-p` option. 

For example, to switch to port 8000, you would use the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/trap -p 8000
```

### Choosing Your Senders

Buggregator Trap provides a variety of "senders" that dictate where the dumps will be sent. Currently, the available sender options include:

- `console`: This option displays dumps directly in the console.
- `server`: With this choice, dumps are sent to a remote Buggregator server.
- `file`: This allows for dumps to be stored in a file for future reference.

By default, the Trap server is set to display dumps in the console. However, you can easily select your preferred senders using the `-s` option. 

For instance, to simultaneously use the console, file, and server senders, you would input:

```bash
vendor/bin/trap -s console -s file -s server
```
